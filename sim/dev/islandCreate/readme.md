# Simple Wave (non polar) Simulations

These simulations exist to help show what is occuring when islands create defects. This one will focus on:
1. Creating a region in the middle of the sample of a non-polar orientation field. This could be quadrapolar, or simply take the absolute value of the 
2. Tracking the defect density

This is based on simulations that Adam did for his thesis. I am forking them here, so we can directly add and change them. I may incorportate the changes back into the main directory, howerver.




## Development Log

### 2020-06-06
- Created directory
- get bare code working 
    - remove islands
    - localize region of higher heat
