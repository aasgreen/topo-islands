#Development Directory

This directory contains code which is ugly. For nice code that I will give a soft garuntee that runs, visit /base, which should have the basic code needed for you to get up and running.


The goals of this development:
1. To extend the lg.f90 program to allow for the user to specify the size of the island to be created
2. To allow for the size of the island to dynamically change over time
