# SinGordon Simulations

These simulations exist to help show what is occuring when islands create defects. This one will focus on:
1. Starting the simulation where the spins are in a sin gordon configuartion (tanh(x/w) where w is the width of this)
2. Turn on an electric field pointing to the left
3. Encode the elastic constant as a landau like parameter, which decreases as the local energy increases.

Things to test and document.
1. Test that the ground state configuration is behaving correctly. 
2. Test that the elastic constant is behaving properly.
3. Figure out the sin gordon theory, so we can choose proper defaults for the parameters.

I am also going to work on moving this over to f2p, as this will make things much easier to test and print out.
