#fortranTest

''' Python code to iteratively test the f2py module, with the goal of building up my langevin simulations, but using the python wrappers to handle input/output.

The first goal is:
    1. To create an nxn array in fortran with a spin configuration
    2. To visualize the nxn array using matplotlib, checking this is working
    3. To modify the update function so that the array can be iterated.
