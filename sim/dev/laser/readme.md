# Laser Simulations

These simulations exist to help show what is occuring when islands create defects. This one will focus on:
1. Creating a localized region of 'hotter' fluid in the center of the simulation
2. Tracking the defect density

This is based on simulations that Adam did for his thesis. I am forking them here, so we can directly add and change them. I may incorportate the changes back into the main directory, howerver.




## Development Log

### 2020-06-06
- Created directory
- get bare code working 
    - remove islands
    - localize region of higher heat
